1. was getting error for frontend not connecting to https profile
	- the launch settings configuration was getting overwritten due to this code in Program.cs file "builder.WebHost.UseUrls("http://0.0.0.0:5000");"
	- got connected from postman after disabling this but was getting this certificate error: net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID.
	solved by these steps:
		- dotnet dev-certs https --clean
		dotnet dev-certs https --trust
		Then:
		Restart your backend
		Restart your browser
		Restart React (npm start)

2. to forcefully run the dotnet on specific profile:
	dotnet run --launch-profile https
	also can run this way: dotnet run --urls "https://localhost:5001"

3. Dotnet help command
	dotnet run --help  

4. To restart the server
	taskkill /f /im dotnet.exe
	taskkill /F /IM node.exe

5. To check whether port is currently in use, and which process is using it.
	netstat -ano | findstr :5173
	check if the application is running on port 5000 or 5001.
		netstat -ano | findstr ":500[01]"
